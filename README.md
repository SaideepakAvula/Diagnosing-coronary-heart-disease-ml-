🚑 Coronary Heart Disease Detection Using Machine Learning 🩺
💡 Harnessing AI for proactive healthcare solutions!

Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, but early detection can significantly improve outcomes. This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning solution for CHD diagnosis using ECG data.

🔍 Project Overview:
🖼️ Image Processing with OpenCV: 
Captured and processed ECG graph images to extract vital data points, ensuring precise feature extraction.

📊 Data Management: 
Efficiently handled data storage and retrieval using Microsoft SQL Server, enabling seamless analysis and scalability.

🤖 Machine Learning Implementation:
Applied supervised learning algorithms to train models on extracted ECG features, achieving reliable CHD predictions.

⚙️ Preprocessing Excellence: 
Leveraged NumPy for efficient numerical operations, data cleaning, and normalization of ECG datasets.

🌟 Key Features:

📈 Accurate Predictions:
Delivers dependable CHD risk assessments based on ECG patterns.

🛠️ Custom Feature Engineering: 
Extracted time-domain and frequency-domain features for better model accuracy.

💡 User-Centric Application:
